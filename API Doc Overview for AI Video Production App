Using Postman with Synthesia.io:

Send the request in Postman by using the URL, method, & extra necessary elements such as params, authorization, headers, body, and scripts:

 	This is the URL I used: https://app.synthesia.io/#/?videosType=MyRecentVideos (don’t currently have creator status access to API*)


I would recommend different tests for edge cases: we want to be able to differentiate valid data VS invalid data in different scenarios:

If an error message is displayed, it is best to document the exact error response for engineering. Later, we must verify the fix after deployment. 




Common issues that customers seem to run into based on API docs:


Synthesia API: 
Videos/Templates/Webhooks
Uploading API:
Script audio and assets (An asset is an image or video which you would like to include in a generated video.)
List of Supported voices:
Supported voices by the Synthesia API with their associated IDs
List of stock avatars:
Supported avatars by the Synthesia API with their associated IDs 
Verifying Synthesia signatures:
You need two things from the webhook Synthesia sent: Timestamp - When it was sent (found in header Synthesia-Timestamp). Afterward, combine the timestamp and body with a . between them.

Possible issues include: ‘Signature mismatch' errors or ‘My webhook secret was compromised’

Scripts supporting XML tags:
Synthesia API scripts support a set of HTML-like tags that let you control timing and pronunciation in generated videos.

Webhooks: 

All webhook events follow the same pattern. At the top level, there will be two keys: one that describes the event that occurred, and one that contains the event-specific payload.

Event (what happened) = "video.completed"
Payload (the details) = video ID, download link, etc.

When customers report webhook issues, I'd start by verifying:

All webhook events follow the same pattern. At the top level, there will be two keys: one that describes the event that occurred, and one that contains the event-specific payload.
1. Configuration - Is the webhook URL correct and active?
2. Endpoint health - Is their server responding with HTTP 200?
3. Payload handling - Are they parsing the JSON correctly?
4. Delivery logs - Can I see if Synthesia successfully sent it?
